We expect the following three files to exist in this directory in order to create the MSI:

1. rep.exe
2. executor.exe
3. garden-windows.exe
4. consul.exe

These files are usually copied over by gocd, but if you're manually creating the MSI you'll need to compile these projects and copy the executable here.
